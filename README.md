# Shopifolk

A web ring for Shopify engineers - interns, full-time employees, and alumni.

## Purpose

Shopifolk serves as a community directory connecting current and former Shopify engineering talent. The site provides a simple way to discover and browse engineers who have been part of the Shopify engineering organization.

## Features

- Browse engineers by name and role
- Filter by semester/cohort (e.g., Fall 2025, Winter 2025, Summer 2025)
- Links to individual profiles or personal sites

## Semesters

The filtering system uses the following notation:
- **F** - Fall (e.g., F25 = Fall 2025)
- **W** - Winter (e.g., W25 = Winter 2025)
- **S** - Summer (e.g., S25 = Summer 2025)

## Contributing

If you are a current or former Shopify engineer and would like to be added to the directory, please submit a pull request or reach out to the maintainers.
